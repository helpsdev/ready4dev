            <p>
                I'm a web developer based in Mexico. Since I was little I was amazed by the computers. 
                I loved spending time on them and investigating how they work. 
                I had to say that more than once I had to reinstall the OS because of touching things I shoudn't or at least not without knowing what could happen.
                I'm passionate about learning new things and that's why I think I love being a developer. There is always room for improvement, things
                are constantly changing so you always have something new to learn.
