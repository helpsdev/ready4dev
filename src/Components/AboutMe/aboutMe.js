            <h3>Education</h3>
            <p>
                I studied at the Autonomus University of Chihuahua, I got the Systems Enginieer degree specialized in Hardware.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've been working in the web development field for 4+ years now. I feel like I learned a lot in these yeras but at the same time
                that there is a lot more to learn.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have a Microsoft Certified Solutions Associate certification in Web Applications

            <h3>Experience</h3>
            <p>
                I started my journey as web developer as an internship in Datazone (an Autozone company). 
                I worked with both Back-end and front-end technologies to complete a project that will help the call center deparment
                to visualize with ease a special type of tickets logged in the ticketing system used there.
            </p>
            <p>
                After that I moved to Mexicali, Baja California, Mexico to be part of the development team of Grupo Red Internet Development, a company dedicated to build software on demand.
                Here I worked also with both Back-end and front-end technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then I moved back to Chihuahua, Mexico where I joined the Gammapartners team, here is where I'm currently working. 
                I've also worked with both Back-end and front-end tecnhonologies.
                Last year we joined the PK Global workforce so we are part of their team now.
            </p>
            <h3>Skills</h3>
            <p>In all these years working as web developer I've learned several different languages and frameworks showing below:</p>
            add a section with the logos of the skills I have experience on
            <h3>My history</h3>
            <p>
                I'm a web developer based in Mexico. Since I was little I was amazed by the computers. 
                I loved spending time on them and learning how they work (and I'm still learning!). 
                I had to say that more than once I had to reinstall the OS because of touching things I shoudn't or not without knowing what could happen if I touched them.
                I'm passionate about learning new things and that's why I think I love being a developer. In this career there is always room for improvement, things
                are constantly changing so you have to be constantly learning.
            </p>
            <p>
                I know my specialization says "Hardware" but believe me, when I was stuidying for my degree there was a lot of programming courses I had to take.
                I always have been in touch with programming since I was in highschool but never took it seriously until I had the chance to 
                do my internship at Datazone. While I was there I had the opportunity to learn a lot of stuff that lead me to the absolute decision
                that I had to become a web developer.
